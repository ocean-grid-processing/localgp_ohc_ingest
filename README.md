# ohc_ingest

`ohc_ingest` turns LocalGP ocean-heat-content (OHC) mapping output into a clean, analysis-ready store, and then into an ME4OH-protocol submission.

The Rust binary is deliberately pure-Rust (no C deps) so it builds to a single static binary
for clusters with no Docker/Rust; all NetCDF work lives in the Python step, where libnetcdf is
already available. Validation is primarily via round-trip crosschecks that comapare outputs to inputs after the fact.

## How this reflects the ME4OH protocol

The submission format is defined by the [ME4OH protocol](https://zenodo.org/records/10291852). The numbers baked into this code come from
there:

- **Grid:** 1×1°, `lon 20.5…379.5`, `lat −89.5…89.5` — the protocol mandates this so no
  regridding is needed for the intercomparison.
- **Units:** OHC density in TJ/m², with `cp0 = 3989.244 J/kg/K`, `rho0 = 1030 kg/m³`.
- **Time:** monthly, days since 1900-01-01.
- **Submission file:** one NetCDF per layer, `DATA(LONGITUDE, LATITUDE, TIME)`, named
  `OHC_<Y0>_<Y1>_lev<low>_<high>_exp<X>_<product>.nc`.
- **Mask:** the protocol's `ocean_mask` is "points not-NaN at all timesteps," so a submission
  communicates "don't use this cell" only via NaN. `publish.py` is where our richer internal
  mask collapses to that NaN convention.

The store the Rust core writes is *not* a protocol artifact — it's our internal representation
(raw data + a bit-band mask, masking nothing). `publish.py` projects it down to the protocol.

## What the Rust core does (scope)

For one mapped layer:

1. Read the LocalGP `.mat` files (FullField mean + 100-member LocalCondSim ensemble), month by
   month.
2. Convert integrated temperature to OHC (`× cp0 × rho0`), preserving NaNs.
3. Transpose month-major input → member-major arrays (buffer the whole layer in RAM).
4. Derive ancillary grids (`etopo`, `basin_id`, `cell_area`) and the `mask_flags` bit band.
5. Write a per-layer zarr v3 store. **No masks are applied to the data** — masking is carried in
   `mask_flags` and applied lazily downstream.

## Inputs

| input | notes |
|---|---|
| LocalGP `.mat` | MATLAB v7 (zlib-compressed); variable `fullFieldGrid`, `[lon,lat]` for the mean and `[lon,lat,100]` for the ensemble. Mean and ensemble live in **separate directories**. |
| `etopo60.cdf` | 1° bathymetry (classic NetCDF); vars `ETOPO60X`/`ETOPO60Y`/`ROSE`; its grid is identical to the mapping grid (asserted, not regridded). Reproduced in this repo under `data/` |
| [`basinmask_04.msk`](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/oceans/woa/WOA18/MASKS/basinmask_04.msk) | WOA 0.25° basin table; nearest-neighbour to the 1° grid, surface column. |

Full provenance, versions, and citations are in [`data/README.md`](data/README.md).

## Output (the zarr store)

`ohc_<tag>_plev<top>_<bottom>.zarr`, containing:

- `ohc_mean` `(time, lat, lon)` — the posterior-mean OHC, J/m², NaN preserved.
- `ohc_ensemble` `(member, time, lat, lon)` — the 100 conditional simulations, chunked one
  file per member.
- `mask_flags` `(lat, lon)` — the bit band, with CF `flag_masks`/`flag_meanings` (see
  [`mask_spec.md`](mask_spec.md)).
- `etopo`, `basin_id`, `cell_area` `(lat, lon)` — ancillaries.

zarr v3, `bytes`+`gzip` codecs (pure Rust), xarray-readable. Layout details in
[`zarr_schema.md`](zarr_schema.md).

## The mask bit band

`mask_flags` is a `uint8` per cell carrying one bit per *reason* a cell might be excluded, so
the store never destroys data — masking is a downstream choice (and, for a submission, collapses
to NaN in `publish.py`). The bits:

| bit | value | name | meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 1 | `bed_above_shallow` | seafloor shallower than the layer's shallow edge (layer entirely in rock) |
| 1 | 2 | `bed_above_deep` | seafloor shallower than the layer's deep edge (seabed cuts through the layer) |
| 2 | 4 | `outside_latitude` | cell outside the kept latitude band |
| 3 | 8 | `removed_basin` | cell in a dropped basin (marginal / enclosed seas) |
| 4 | 16 | `never_estimated` | LocalGP produced no value in any month |
| 5 | 32 | `incomplete_timeseries` | valid in some months but not all |
| 6 | 64 | `bed_above_floor` | seafloor shallower than a fixed floor depth, applied uniformly to every layer (set only when `bathy_floor_m` is configured) |
| 7 | 128 | `ensemble_incomplete` | some CondSim member is NaN-in-time here even if the mean is finite (unset for a `--no-ensemble` store) |

Bits 0/1/4/5/7 are physical/validity reasons; bits 2/3/6 are policy reasons. `publish.py`'s two
presets pick different subsets — notably `wmo` honors `bed_above_shallow` (fully-dry cells) but
*not* `bed_above_deep` (partial slope cells are kept). Full definitions, the exact preset subsets,
the selector conventions, and the monotonic-bathymetry sentinel are in [`mask_spec.md`](mask_spec.md).

## Usage

Here we enumerate and illustrate how to build, test and run the rust and python components in this repo, with examples and tables of options.

### Ingest step: .mat -> .zarr, in rust

#### Test

Test locally from a bare rust container, in the root of this repo:

```
docker container run -w /app -v $(pwd):/app rust:1.88 cargo test --lib
```

Note you need to download `basinmask_04.msk` into `data/`, or at least one of these tests will fail. Don't forget to do the same on your production cluster.

#### Build

The rust ingestion script is meant to be easy to compile into a fully static binary `dist/ohc_ingest` that can be committed to this repo and checked out along with the slurm and config files for running on Blanca:


```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile.static --target bin --output type=local,dest=dist .
```

#### Run

See [`ohc_ingest.slurm`](ohc_ingest.slurm) for a practical run example on blanca.

Settings fall into three kinds by where they live:

- **Per-run slice** — the one layer + time window this run processes. Required; given on the CLI
  (or env). Never in the config file.
- **Run options** — modifiers for this one invocation (mean-only mode, per-run I/O dir overrides).
- **Static config** — product/environment constants (units, domain, mask policy, grid paths).
  From a `config.toml` (positional arg), or built-in defaults when no config is given. Template:
  [`config.example.toml`](config.example.toml).

**Precedence** — wherever a setting has more than one possible source, the decending order of precedence is **CLI flag → environment variable → `config.toml` → built-in default**, with two wrinkles:

1. The **path env vars are read only when no `config.toml` is passed** — a config file and the env
   don't mix (the config is taken as authoritative for everything it can hold).
2. The **`--dir_*` CLI flags always win**, overriding the directory whether it came from config or
   env — the one hook for munging I/O paths per submission while keeping constants in one config.

##### Per-run slice — required (CLI flag, or env)

| setting | CLI | env | example |
|---|---|---|---|
| run tag | `--tag` | `OHC_TAG` | `OP20260110` — labels the store + all metadata |
| layer | `--layer` | `OHC_LAYER` | `15-300`, `300_700`, `700:1850` (integer dbar; exactly one; sep `-`/`_`/`:`) |
| years | `--years` | `OHC_YEARS` | `2016`, `2004:2025` |
| months | `--months` | `OHC_MONTHS` | `8`, `1:3`, `1,6,12` |

##### Run options (CLI flag, or env)

| setting | CLI | env | default | effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| mean-only | `--no-ensemble` | `OHC_NO_ENSEMBLE` (set = on) | off | skip the LocalCondSim files; omit `ohc_ensemble` from the store |
| mean dir | `--dir_mean` | `OHC_DIR_MEAN` ¹ | config / `.` | FullField mean `.mat` directory |
| ensemble dir | `--dir_ensemble` | `OHC_DIR_ENSEMBLE` ¹ | config / `.` | LocalCondSim `.mat` directory |
| output dir | `--dir_out` | `OHC_DIR_OUT` ¹ | config / `.` | where the zarr store is written |

¹ path env vars apply **only when no `config.toml` is passed**; `--dir_*` flags override regardless.
`--no-ensemble` is for mean-only products or an incomplete CondSim set:
`publish.py` then emits `DATA` without `DATA_SD`, and `--ensemble` on such a store errors.

##### Static config (`config.toml` key, or built-in default)

No CLI or env for these except the three dirs above (and the two grid paths, via env in no-config
mode). Keys marked **req** have no built-in default *when a `config.toml` is present* — the example
config sets them; in no-config mode the listed default applies.

| key | default | req | effect |
|---|---|:--:|---|
| `var_name` | `potentialTemperature` | req | `.mat` filename token — the mapped variable |
| `model_name` | `SpaceTimeTrend` | req | `.mat` filename token — the mapping model |
| `latitude_range_to_keep` | `[-64.5, 64.5]` | req | latitude band kept → the `outside_latitude` bit |
| `basins_to_remove` | `[0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 53]` | req | basin ids dropped → the `removed_basin` bit |
| `etopo_path` | `etopo60.cdf` | req | bathymetry grid; env `OHC_ETOPO` in no-config mode |
| `basinmask_path` | `basinmask_04.msk` | req | basin table; env `OHC_BASINMASK` in no-config mode |
| `bathy_floor_m` | *(none = off)* | | uniform floor depth (m) → the `bed_above_floor` bit; WMO/GCOS uses `300.0` |
| `missing_sentinel` | *(none = off)* | | raw mapping value treated as missing → NaN at ingest; WMO/GCOS uses `0.0` |
| `cp0` | `3989.244` | | OHC scale `cp0·rho0`, J/(kg·K) |
| `rho0` | `1030.0` | | OHC scale `cp0·rho0`, kg/m³ |
| `dir_mean` / `dir_ensemble` / `dir_out` | `.` | | I/O directories (usually set per-run via the `--dir_*` flags above) |

### Pythonic publish (.zarr -> .nc) & crosschecks (.mat vs .zarr and .mat vs .nc)

After a .zarr store is formed, publish.py applies opinionated masking decisions and generates a .nc compliant with the ME4OH spec. Additionally, we validate this piece of the pipeline with two crosscheck scripts, that compare the contents of the .zarr store with the contents of the original .mat, and similarly compare the final .nc with the original .mat.

#### Environmnet

The python environment for performing integrity crosschecks and publishing to an ME4OH-compliant .nc is described in `Dockerfile.python`; build and mount into this environment, or make an equivalent one in anaconda on CU's cluster for use with slurm.

#### Run

##### publish.py — make the ME4OH submission

Projects a store to a compliant `.nc`: collapses the selected mask bits to NaN, converts
J/m² → TJ/m² and the time axis to days-since-1900, and writes `DATA(LONGITUDE, LATITUDE, TIME)`
(float64 by default) under the ME4OH filename. By default it also adds `DATA_SD` (ensemble 1σ —
the protocol's "associated uncertainties, where available"), computed from `ohc_ensemble`. See [`publish.slurm`](publish.slurm) for a submission example.

###### Script options:

| option | default | effect |
|---|---|---|
| `STORE.zarr` (positional) | *(required)* | the input zarr store |
| `--experiment` | *(required)* | ME4OH experiment letter (`A`/`B`/…) — the `exp<X>` filename token |
| `--product` | store's `mapped_fields_tag` | product name in the filename |
| `--preset` | `me4oh` | which mask bits collapse to NaN — `me4oh` or `wmo` (see below) |
| `--levels LOW,HIGH` | store's layer bounds | override the filename's layer bounds (meters) |
| `--no-uncertainty` | off | skip `DATA_SD` (and the full-ensemble read) |
| `--ensemble` | off | also write the full ensemble sibling `OHCENS_<...>.nc` (see below) |
| `--dtype` | `float64` | dtype for `DATA`/`DATA_SD` — `float64` (the mean is f64 in the store, since the GCOS anomaly is a large-mean cancellation) or `float32`. The ensemble sibling stays f32 either way. |
| `--out` | `.` | output directory |

**Mask presets** (`--preset`): `me4oh` (default) honors only the physical/validity bits
(`never_estimated`, `incomplete_timeseries`, `bed_above_shallow`, `bed_above_deep`) — the honest,
maximal valid field, letting the assessment define the common domain. `wmo` is our
latitude/basin-cropped product: it adds `outside_latitude`, `removed_basin`, `bed_above_floor`, and
`ensemble_incomplete`, and — deliberately — honors `bed_above_shallow` (fully-dry cells) but **not**
`bed_above_deep` (partial continental-slope cells are kept). Exact bit subsets in
[`mask_spec.md`](mask_spec.md).

**Mean-only stores:** a store produced by the rust with `--no-ensemble` has no `ohc_ensemble`; publish detects this, writes `DATA` without `DATA_SD` (with a note), and `--ensemble` on such a store is an error.

`--ensemble` writes the full ensemble as a sibling `OHCENS_<...>.nc` with
`DATA(MEMBER, LONGITUDE, LATITUDE, TIME)` — same mask, units, and time axis as the submission (but
always f32) — for downstream uses that derive per-member quantities before collapsing to a spread.
It is not an ME4OH submission (distinct filename, extra dimension), so the assessment's `OHC_*.nc`
discovery won't pick it up.

##### Crosscheck verification (two independent round-trips against the `.mat`)

Both use `scipy.io.loadmat` as an independent reader (not our Rust parser), so they're genuine
oracles; both load sizeable arrays, so run them inside the job allocation.

- **`verify_store.py`** — three positional args (`STORE.zarr DIR_MEAN DIR_ENSEMBLE`), no flags. It
  auto-detects a mean-only store and skips the ensemble check (then `DIR_ENSEMBLE` is unused).
- **`verify_publish.py`** — the same three positional args, plus `--no-sd` (skip the `DATA_SD`
  check) and `--ensemble` (also check the `OHCENS_<...>.nc` sibling member-by-member).

Complete cluster jobs: [`verify_store.slurm`](verify_store.slurm) and
[`verify_publish.slurm`](verify_publish.slurm).

**Tolerances** track the stored precision, not bit-for-bit. `verify_store` compares at float32
precision (both sides cast; exact match expected). `verify_publish` adapts to the published `DATA`
dtype — ~1e-12 for float64 (the default) and ~1e-6 for float32 (the float32 `/1e12` rounding) —
with the float32 ensemble checks (`DATA_SD`, `OHCENS`) held to the looser float32 tolerance. A real
bug (transpose flip, unit error, wrong month) is still caught.
